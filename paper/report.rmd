# Abstract

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its large impact across Spain, the monitoring of demographic measures as a direct result of deaths related to such pandemic and future similarly deadly events has become increasingly important. It is intended with this project to develop a tool in order to easily monitor a selection of demographic measures relating to collective deaths of individuals as a result of relevant worldwide events like the one mentioned previously. The tool consists of a shiny dashboard (developed in R) where such measures are displayed in different visualizations across time.
